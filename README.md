# Document-image-binarization-with-Cascaded-cGANs-generator

##tools: 
-------
1.The python code is based on the python data science platform Anaconda3. 
2.The python code is tested on Windows by PyCharm.
3.Install PyTorch and dependencies from http://pytorch.org


##Testing:
-------
1. few example test images are included in the testimg folder.
3.Run Test_All.py, test the binarization of an input image. 


##Acknowledgments:
-------
This code borrows heavily from pytorch-CycleGAN-and-pix2pix.
