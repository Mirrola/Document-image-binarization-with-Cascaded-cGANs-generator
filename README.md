# Document-image-binarization-with-Cascaded-cGANs-generator

tools: 
-------
1.The python code is based on the python data science platform Anaconda3. 

2.The python code is tested on Windows by PyCharm.

3.Install PyTorch and dependencies from http://pytorch.org


Testing:
-------
1. few example test images are included in the testimg folder.

2. Run Test_All.py, test the binarization of an input image. 

3. Please download the pre-trained model from [here](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1Q1c19Sc7ubY7TATSZfKedw) , and put it under ./checkpoints/
